## Projects Overview

1. **Healthcare Attrition Report using Power BI**  
   - **Link:** [Healthcare Attrition Report using Power BI](./HealthCare%20Attrition%20Report%20using%20Power%20BI)  
   - **Description:** An interactive Power BI dashboard project focusing on employee attrition within a healthcare organization. This analysis leverages data transformations in Power Query, dynamic DAX calculations, and visual storytelling techniques to reveal churn trends, cost implications, and department-level insights. By enabling drill-down filters and clear data visualizations, the dashboard empowers HR and management teams to make informed decisions on employee retention strategies and workforce planning.

2. **CNN Bird Species Image Classification**  
   - **Link:** [CNN Bird Species Classification Optimization](./cnn-bird-species-img-classification-optimization.ipynb)  
   - **Description:** A Python-based Convolutional Neural Network project leveraging TensorFlow/Keras and Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization, aiming to classify bird species images and demonstrate improved accuracy through model tuning.

3. **Tree-Based Models & Ensemble Learning**  
   - **Link:** [Tree-Based Models & Ensemble Learning Algorithms](./tree-based-models-and-ensemble-learning-algorithms%20(1).ipynb)  
   - **Description:** A comprehensive project leveraging ensemble techniques—tuned decision trees, voting classifiers, random forests, and stochastic gradient boosting—to predict stroke risk from healthcare data. The analysis employs Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, and addresses class imbalance through SMOTE and random undersampling. Evaluations using ROC curves, classification reports, and feature importance visualizations showcase the strengths of each ensemble method, ultimately highlighting critical risk factors like age. This robust framework demonstrates real-world applicability for proactive patient risk profiling and early intervention in clinical settings.

4. **K-Means Clustering for Data Analysis**  
   - **Link:** [Data Analysis Using K-Means Clustering](./data-analysis-using-k-means-clustering.ipynb)  
   - **Description:** Implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy, focusing on centroid initialization, iterative cluster assignment, and convergence criteria. Visualized results using Matplotlib to demonstrate the clustering process on synthetic datasets.

5. **Sentiment Analysis of Airlines Tweets**  
   - **Link:** [Sentiment Analysis of Airlines Tweets](./sentiment-analysis-of-airlines-tweets.ipynb)  
   - **Description:** A comprehensive R project leveraging Tidyverse, tidytext, and Shiny to analyze airline tweets through advanced text cleaning, tokenization, sentiment comparison using both native labels and the NRC lexicon, topic modeling, and interactive visualizations for deep insights into customer perceptions.

6. **Linear Regression with Wine Quality Dataset**  
   - **Link:** [Linear Regression on Wine Quality](./linear-regression-with-wine-quality-dataset%20(1).ipynb)  
   - **Description:** A Python-based project applying both simple and multiple linear regression on the "Red Wine Quality" dataset, predicting wine density using gradient descent—with L2 regularization in the multiple regression model—and visualizing cost convergence and prediction accuracy.

7. **Logistic Regression with Stroke Dataset**  
   - **Link:** [Logistic Regression with Stroke Dataset](./logistic-regression-with-stroke-dataset.ipynb)  
   - **Description:** Implemented logistic regression on a stroke prediction dataset. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature normalization, one-hot encoding, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and undersampling. The model is trained using sklearn's LogisticRegression and evaluated on separate train, validation, and test sets.

8. **Bella Beats Case Study**  
   - **Link:** [Bella Beats Case Study](./bella-beats-case-study.ipynb)  
   - **Description:** A data analysis project in R using Tidyverse libraries (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, etc.) to examine smart device activity and sleep logs, uncovering insights on physical activity, calorie expenditure, and sleep efficiency to inform Bella Beat’s product and marketing strategies.
